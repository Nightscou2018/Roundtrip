# Roundtrip

Roundtrip is a limited port of OpenAPS (author Ben West) into an Android application.  This application is highly experimental and potentionally quite dangerous.  It has been shared with fellow OpenAPS researchers who have already demonstrated equalivalent capability and the ability to appropriately use the software with appropriate safety precautions.  As members of the OpenAPS community we share a common goal to enhance APS technologies and help bring about more timely advances in the treatment of diabetes.  Please do not share or distribute this software with anyone else. </br>
