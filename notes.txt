Reading pump settings (as an example)

The ReadPumpSettingsCommand is a MedtronicCommand.  With a bit of initialization, it is a thin layer over the MedtronicCommand.

The base class MedtronicCommand has a run() function that prepares a packet for the Pump (i.e. not for the RileyLink) then creates a packet (called TransmitPacketCommand) for the RileyLink

The TransmitPacketCommand data includes the Medtronic packet as a member.

  [RileyLink packet [Pump packet]]

The TransmitPacketCommand (a RileyLinkCommand) uses a BluetoothConnection (a.k.a GattManager) to write the packet to a bluetooth characteristic.  Currently, BluetoothConnection::queue immediately attempts to "drive" the bluetooth send queue.

Results flow back up to the MedtronicCommand command.
